- minSdkVersion is 15 (4.0.3) 
- The function callFunctionInBackground returns an empty array probably because there is a fixed distance value in the backend. I still need to test that function with the return value. 
- I added a dummy data in case callFunctionInBackground returns empty array.

Future Improvements: 
The UX and UI could have been improved in different ways, example: 

- Progress bubble between the MainActivity and the ListActivity instead of android native progressdialog.
- Adding a swipe to refresh to the listview. 
- Changing the whole UX instead of 2 activities, it could be 2 fragments and one activity and a seperator in the middle. 
- Translating the app.
